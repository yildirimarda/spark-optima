#   On the host, with your own gh session:

========================================================
Done. Two manual steps remain:

1) Give the agent token access to this repo.
   ONE token serves all your agentloop projects — if you already have it,
   just add this repo to its list:
     github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens
       -> your agent token -> Repository access -> add this repo
   Creating it for the first time:
     github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
     · Repository access -> Only select repositories -> your agentloop repos
     · Permissions -> Contents: Read and write
     · Permissions -> Pull requests: Read and write
     · Permissions -> Actions: Read-only   (CI verdict polling — note:
       GitHub offers no "Checks" permission on fine-grained PATs)
     · Select NOTHING else (no admin, no org scopes)

   Then store it in the keychain:
     security add-generic-password -s gh-agent -a "$USER" -w 'github_pat_...'

2) Let Actions open and merge pull requests:
   Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions
     · Select "Read and write permissions"
     · Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
